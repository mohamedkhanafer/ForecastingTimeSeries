In this repository, I share some code and reports on projects related to Time Series Analysis. 

# 1. Modeling Coca-Cola's quarterly's earnings
In this project, I develop linear time series models using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola. 
I build 5 models in total and compare them in terms of forecasting using both the Recursive Scheme and the Rolling Scheme. 

The R code and detailed report of the analysis as well as the data used for this project can be found in the folder 1_Coca_Cola_Earnings_Models.
